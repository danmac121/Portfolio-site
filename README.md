# Portfolio-site

## Description
This is the repo for my portfolio site. I used a combination of CSS grid and Flexbox to align my elements on the page and media queries to make the page responsive. I also used filters on the images of my work, which are removed when the image is hovered over. The links in my nav bar will scroll the page to the appropriate section. The images in my "Previous Work section" function as links to deployed projects where applicable and the links in my contact me section will take the user to the applicable website.

[This is a link to the deployed website](https://danmac121.github.io/Portfolio-site/)
